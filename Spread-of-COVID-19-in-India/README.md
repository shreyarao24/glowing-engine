# The Spread of COVID-19 in India

This project focused on analysing trends present in COVID-19 data sourced from worldometer. An initial analysis was performed on data from all around the world by comparing the trend of cases and deaths in the top 5 countries with the most number of cases. The report then focuses on the transmission within India, and aims to answer two questions -

1. What are the factors that led to Maharashtra developing such a high number of cases?
2. Which state has the highest death rate, and why?

All analyses were performed using the pandas and matplotlib modules in Python 3.
